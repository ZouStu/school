# Final Project: 
## About Me Markdown Document
**After this semester I may switch to flipping homes**
*Or maybe that will just be a side project*

+ At Home I have three children that like to distract me from homework:
  * Madi
  * Oliver
  *	Natalie
    

When it's not the kids, my distractions are usually: 

1. My wife Nikki
2. Small dog Kodi that thinks he's big
3. Big dog Reece that thinks she's small 


## Jeeps are probably my biggest hobby at this point
