**This assignment turned into a rant after I had a bad day at work**
*You have been warned*

+ Ways my current customers are driving me insane:
  * Setting expections and not sharing what they are
  * Writting vague sentences in the contract assumption statements and saying they are legally binding
  *	Declaring deliverables are late while also blocking them
    

What I miss about being with a startup company

1. Not having eight corporate overlords that all ask for project updates in different formats
2. Walking over to the desk of the Executive VP to get technical guidance and actually receiving it 
3. Beer in the office fridge
